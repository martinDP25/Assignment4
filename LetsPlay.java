// -------------------------------------------------------
// Assignment 4
// Written by: Matthew Da Silva - 40008582
// For COMP 248 Section EE â€“ Fall 2018
//
// The following program is a game involves 2-10 players, gardens, and planting flowers and trees. 
// A total of 4 classes were used, including the driver class (Dice, Garden, Player, LetsPlay-DRIVER).
// Setting up the Dice, Garden, and Player class was relatively simple. It was a matter of following instructions
// in the outline, along with some programming knowledge learned in class. The depth of the assignment came in the 
// driver class, where all the other classes and their methods are called upon to be used for their specific functions. 
// The most time consuming part of the driver class had to be the actual game part. Having loops within loops within IF statements
// within more loops (you get it) required a solid amount of brain power for me to complete this assignment. Although it 
// was lengthy, I can say that I learned a significant amount more compared to other assignments.
